                <p>My heuristics present the fact that IMDb is not set up how it is used. It should be similar to Wikipedia, but has a lot of unecessary and often hidden rarely used features.</p>
                <p>I personally dont think this data would be used by the company. However, I do think that a scrictly informative site for media, such as a wiki, would do its job better.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>While I do think this website has many shortcomings, I also can appreciate its design, and its attempt to provide more user engagement. It's not really the site's fault that the majority of it is ignored, but I do think the company should do a better job of adapting to how its used.</p>
